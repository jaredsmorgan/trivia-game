####About This Game  
This trivia game was created for all history enthusiasts (myself included) using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game has a format similar to jeopardy, _no lightning rounds_ included. The user chooses the question category, point value, and answer. Then they are notified wether they are correct or not and can choose to restart the game or keep going. All questions used were taken from the trivia questions reference at the bottom of this file. A big thank you to Daphne Mintz who contributed the name for this game.

####Getting Started  
To play this game simply click on the link above or download the repo [from this link](https://github.com/mmarmol88/trivia-game). Once you have downloaded the repo, open the index.html file on your browser.

####Trials and Tribulations  
The overall goal for this game was to provide the user with randomized trivia questions. I started by adding the questions straight into HTML in order to refine the logic. There were many console errors as the code developed, this helped me refine my approach to event targeting and logic progression. I would like to add random-question functionality to the question options grid.  
####Features  
 **Bronze:**  
 An HTML page with a grid of buttons that serve as question selectors to begin the game. Once a button is clicked the corresponding question is displayed. The user can then choose an answer and notified wether the response is correct or incorrect etc..

**Silver:**  
An HTML page with a Welcome page and start button that displays the game area. Features are the same as bronze but with the addition of being able to re-start and track score.

**Gold:**
An HTML with multi-player, randomized questions and timed game functionality in addition to the functionalities of the bronze and silver versions.
