####Trials and Tribulations  
The overall goal for this game was to provide the user with randomized trivia questions. I started by adding the questions straight into HTML in order to refine the logic. There were many console errors as the code developed, this helped me refine my approach to event targeting and logic progression. I would like to add random-question functionality to the question options grid.  
####Features  
 **Bronze:**  
 An HTML page with a grid of buttons that serve as question selectors to begin the game. Once a button is clicked the corresponding question is displayed. The user can then choose an answer and notified wether the response is correct or incorrect etc..

**Silver:**  
An HTML page with a Welcome page and start button that displays the game area. Features are the same as bronze but with the addition of being able to re-start and track score.

**Gold:**
An HTML with multi-player, randomized questions and timed game functionality in addition to the functionalities of the bronze and silver versions.
